## About Me
I am a final-year Ph.D. student at **Rutgers ECE Department**, advised by [Prof. Yuqian Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/yuqianzhang). I also work closely with [Prof. Xin Bing](https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/xinbing/). Previously, I earned my bachelor's degree from the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).**

My research focuses on the theoretical guarantees for statistical methods in machine learning and optimization problems. I am also interested in real-world applications of these methods.
